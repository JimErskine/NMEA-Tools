NMEA Tools
======================================

This is a limited set of Python-based NMEA data acquisition and conversion tools.

The primary user story is this:

    As an owner of several nautical chartplotters, one of which has only NMEA-0183 access,
    I need to extract waypoints and routes from this chartplotter,
    So I can coordinate data between various devices.
